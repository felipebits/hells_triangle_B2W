# Hell Triangle - Challenge
Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom
Example:
6
3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4
In this triangle the maximum total is: 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26
An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row.
For example: The element 3 in the 2nd row can only be summed with 9 and 7, but not with
1
Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.
The triangle from above would be:
example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
Choose the programming language you want and let us know why did you choose it.
Besides the solution itself, write automated tests for your code (using a known framework
or another function/method)
Describe well how to execute your code and/or how to build it. Use the README.md to
describe these points and also other points that you would like to add.
It must be delivered via Github or Bitbucket.
We are interested in your solution considering:
 1. Correctness
 2. Readability
 3. Automated Tests
 4. Execution Time
